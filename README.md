ES2018 and Beyond talk
======================

Slides for a talk about ES2018 and what will/should/could come next.

Originally conceived for the [Milano JS Good Party 2018](https://good-party.now.sh/) in Milan, 2018-05-16.

Built on top of [Big](https://github.com/tmcw/big) + some h4ckz!

## Build & watch

To build the presentation:
```
npm run build
```
It will put the result in the `public` folder, which you can serve.

You can also (build and) serve it with
```
npm run serve
```

Add `:watch` to the above script names to also watch for file modifications (it won't refresh the page).

To clean up:
```
npm run clean
```

## Tests

... what?
